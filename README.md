## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM 

The main objective of the project is to design a real-time FM radio signal processor and produce audio sound for the user. This project uses Python as the design verification tool and implemented the system on a Raspberry Pi Microcontroller using C++. 

Some important operating system concepts are used for the design: MUTEX and multi-threading. With the help of multi-threading, the signal processing and calculation is able to run in parallel with an achievement of 32.4% overall speed up for the system. 

Some Python libraries are used for design verification such as matplot and numpy in this project.
